# nhl-style

I created a few css styles to make nhl.com look a little more appealing to me. All I want to see is the scores, standings and leaderboard so I got rid of everything else.

If thye change the class names, I'll just rewrite my css.

start by install the Stylish extension on the Chrome Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)

or firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)

And import the css script from this project.
