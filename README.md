# nhl-style

I created a few css styles to make nhl.com look a little more appealing to me. All I want to see is the scores, standings and leaderboard so I got rid of everything else.

Here is what it looks like:

If they change the class names, I'll just rewrite my css.

Instructions
============

1. Install Stylish for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en),
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/),
[Safari](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.sobolev.stylish-5555L95H45).

2. Once installed, \[For Chrome\] Click on the "Stylish" extension button in the top right of the browser and click "manage installed styles".

3. On the left hand side click on the "Write a new style" button.

4. Open this Github project and go to [nhl.css](https://github.com/bizzk3t/nhl-style/raw/master/nhl.css) file and copy the code.

5. Paste the code into the text area.

6. At the bottom of the page where it says "Applies to" click on the "Specify" button and choose from the list "URLs on this domain".
  * note: if there is a problem with styling on the rest of the site, set it to "URL" instead of "URLs on this domain".

7. Then type in input box "www.nhl.com" without the quotes and click "add"

8. Then go to the top left, add a title and click "save". It should work now!

The page should look like this:

Good luck! :)
